# AllUCanEverKnow
A midterm project for Major Studio I that used my LinkedIn and Spotify search query data to explore, provoke, and undo the notion of a “self.” Translating my data to pitch, I built an audio-interactive p5.js project rooted in the deconstruction of search, toying with the idea: What happens when asking questions only leads to more?

If I had more time for this project, I'd more efficiently call load sounds with for loops, make the search line cursor blink, and make it compatible for mobile devices.
